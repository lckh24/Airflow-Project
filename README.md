## **Summary**:  
In this project, i built a data warehouse using a sales dataset from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform. I designed and implemented a complete ETL pipeline orchestrated by Apache Airflow, with data stored and modeled in PostgreSQL following a star schema. To support analytical processing, we also set up an OLAP server for multidimensional queries. For visualization, we used Microsoft Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports, allowing users to explore the sales data and uncover business insights.
